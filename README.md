# H<sup>2</sup>O --- Lightweight CMS

H<sup>2</sup>O is a simple but powerful CMS written in PHP.
It is specifically designed to have very few basic features,
 but to be very extendable for those that need it.

In H<sup>2</sup>O, the GUI is the entry point.
It doesn't need any framework or routing engine to work,
 but can be adapted to do so,
 which makes it easy to incorporate it into an existing framework.
All H<sup>2</sup>O needs is a backend to store pages in, an authentication controller that can give a go or no-go, and a preprocessor to convert input by the webmaster to a formatted page.
H<sup>2</sup>O is format-agnostic; it can use virtually any markup language you can imagine.
HTML, Markdown, BB-code or something completely different.

The goal for H<sup>2</sup>O is to be simple to install, use and maintain.
Its target audience is those who feel that modern web application frameworks have grown too complex for simple tasks.
